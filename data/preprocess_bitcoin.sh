# This script is only used to preprocess the JSON file with the Bitcoin market price and to convert it into a csv file.
# To download the JSON file with the Bitcoin market price, go to https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/charts/market-price and export the JSON file with the following parameters:
#   "metric1": "market-price", "metric2": "market-price", "type": "linear", "average": "1d", "timespan": "all"
# The computed Bitcoin market price is the average market price per month, since we also compute average ransoms per month.
# You can redirect the output of this script into a file of your choice, e.g. `./preprocess_bitcoin.sh market-price.json > bitcoin_market_price.csv`
